# Prompt-Filter
This is an HTML file that creates a web page for a "Prompt Filter" application. The user can enter a list of items separated by commas in an input field, and then click a submit button to filter out unwanted items. The filtered list is displayed in a div element with the id "output".

There are four additional buttons in the application:

    Copy button with the id "copy-btn" that copies the filtered list to the clipboard
    Delete button with the id "delete-btn" that clears the filtered list from the screen
    Save button with the id "save-btn" that saves the filtered list to a file
    Load button with the id "load-btn" that allows the user to select a file to load into the application.

The application is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Font Awesome library for the button icons. The creator of the application is Napo_II, as indicated in the footer of the page.
