<a href="https://napoii.github.io/Prompt-Filter/">Prompt-Filter online Tool</a>

This is an HTML file that creates a web page for a "Prompt Filter" application. The user can enter a list of items separated by commas in an input field, and then click a submit button to filter out unwanted items. The filtered list is displayed in a div element with the id "output".

There are four additional buttons in the application:

    - Copy button with the id "copy-btn" that copies the filtered list to the clipboard
    - Delete button with the id "delete-btn" that clears the filtered list from the screen
    - Save button with the id "save-btn" that saves the filtered list to a file
    - Load button with the id "load-btn" that allows the user to select a file to load into the application.

The application is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Font Awesome library for the button icons. The creator of the application is Napo_II, as indicated in the footer of the page.

## How to Use

To use Prompt Filter, simply enter items separated by commas into the input field on the page. Once you have entered your items, click the submit button. Prompt Filter will then filter your input and display only the unique items.

In addition to the filtered result, Prompt Filter also offers several options for manipulating your data. You can copy the result to your clipboard, delete the current result, save the result to a file, and load a previously saved result. These options are available via the buttons displayed below the filtered result.
Technologies Used

Prompt Filter is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web application uses the Font Awesome icon library for its buttons.
